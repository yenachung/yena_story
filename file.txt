	By Yena Chung & Eugene Yee

Once upon a time there was a boy named Tim.

He went to the bakery one day and purchased some bagels.

He went to the pet store next door and looked at the puppies.

After that, he went home, but then realized he left his bread at the pet store.

He went all the way back to the pet store, but by that time, the bread was missing!

He asked the store clerk, "Hey, did you see a loaf of bread around here?"

Just as he finished his question, he noticed crumbs on the clerk's shirt...

...
